# Text-to-Speech Script Generation Instructions

You are creating an audio script for a research paper that will be read aloud using text-to-speech.

Your task is to transform this research paper into a natural, easy-to-listen script. Follow these rules:

## 1. START with a brief introduction (2-3 sentences) that includes:

- The paper title
- Main topic/purpose based on the abstract
- Key finding or contribution

## 2. SKIP entirely:

- Keywords section
- Author names and affiliations
- References section
- Acknowledgments
- In-text citations like [1], [2], (Smith et al., 2023)
- Figure and table descriptions (e.g., "See Figure 1", "Table 2 shows...")
- Mathematical equations and formulas

## 3. SKIP the abstract section when reading the main body

Since you already used it in the introduction, don't read it again in the body.

## 4. For the MAIN CONTENT:

- Read the Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion, and Conclusion sections
- Use natural transitions between sections (e.g., "In the methods section...")
- Simplify overly technical phrases when possible
- Maintain the key scientific concepts and findings
- Use "the authors" or "the researchers" instead of specific names

## 5. FORMATTING for audio:

- Write in complete, natural sentences
- Use transitions like "The results show that...", "Interestingly...", "In conclusion..."
- Avoid parenthetical asides
- Convert acronyms to full words on first use (e.g., "Machine Learning, or ML")
- Do not include any stage directions or any details of production.
- Following on from summarising the paper, then proceed to reading the paper, without the abstract and the references.
